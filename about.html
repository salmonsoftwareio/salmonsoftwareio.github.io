                <p class="lead">At <span class="company-name">Salmon Software</span>, we believe in swimming against the current—just like the salmon that inspired our name. Born from a lifetime of problem-solving, perseverance, and a relentless drive to build, our journey started long before the code.</p>
                
                <div class="about-block">
                    <h2>A Story Written in Pixels and Determination</h2>
                    <p>Before we were developers, we were kids—curious, hungry to learn, and always searching for the next challenge. It started with a Game Boy at age three, puzzles that needed solving, and a grandmother who encouraged every step forward. She was our first player two, our biggest supporter, and the reason we never stopped pushing to figure things out. From those early days of tinkering with technology to a decade spent repairing IT infrastructure for a global company, every moment built toward this: the ability to create something truly our own.</p>

                    <h2>Swimming Upstream to Bring Quality to Everyone</h2>
                    <p>Too many apps today are rushed, shallow, and built for quick monetization instead of real engagement. We're here to change that. At Salmon Software, we craft high-quality, polished experiences designed to be enjoyed by everyone—whether you're a lifelong gamer, a casual puzzle solver, or someone who just appreciates well-made software.</p>
                    <p>We're not interested in following the crowd. We believe in doing things right, building apps with care, and creating experiences that stand the test of time.</p>
